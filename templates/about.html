    <h2>About This Project</h2>
    <p>
        This House Price Prediction tool is an advanced machine learning project designed to estimate house prices based on various factors. Developed as a demonstration project, it incorporates the following key features:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Data Source:</b> Utilizes data from the 1990 California census.</li>
        <li><b>AI Model:</b> Built using the RandomForestRegressor algorithm, a robust and reliable model for regression tasks.</li>
        <li><b>Book Reference:</b> The model and techniques are derived from Aurélien Géron's acclaimed book "Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras, and TensorFlow" (Second Edition), specifically Chapter 2 on End-to-End Machine Learning Projects.</li>
        <li><b>Key Factors Considered:</b>The predictor takes into account location, ocean proximity, population density, median income, and median age.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        The aim is to showcase the practical application of machine learning in real-world scenarios. While the predictions are based on historical data and advanced algorithms, they are intended for educational and demonstration purposes only. Explore the potential of AI in the real estate market with this tool.
